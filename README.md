# 🧠 PyDANTIC Langchain Agent (with Ollama)

This is a simple AI agent project using **PyDANTIC**, **Langchain**, and **Ollama** to simulate intelligent agent behavior.

---

## 📌 Project Summary

**PyDANTIC (Purely Dynamic and Driven Agent)** is a framework for building AI agents that adapt to their environment without needing prior knowledge. These agents:
- Learn from experience
- Make decisions dynamically
- Optimize actions based on feedback

This project showcases how PyDANTIC agents behave in different environments using Langchain and Ollama (without API keys).
